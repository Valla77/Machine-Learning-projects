# Supervised Machine Learning project - Walmart : predict weekly sales
This project has been presented as part of my Machine Learning Engineer certificate for the Jedha Data Fullstack program.

## Company

Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

## Project

Construct a machine learning framework capable of predicting weekly sales in their establishments with the utmost accuracy. This model would enhance their comprehension of the correlation between economic indicators and sales, potentially serving as a tool for devising forthcoming marketing campaigns.

## Deliverable

To complete this project, your team should: 

- Create some visualizations
- Train at least one **linear regression model** on the dataset, that predicts the amount of weekly sales as a function of the other variables
- Assess the performances of the model by using a metric that is relevant for regression problems
- Interpret the coefficients of the model to identify what features are important for the prediction
- Train at least one model with **regularization (Lasso or Ridge)** to reduce overfitting
