# Supervised Machine Learning project - Challenge : predict conversions
This project has been presented as part of my Machine Learning Engineer certificate for the Jedha Data Fullstack program.

## Company

www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists. Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !

## Project and Goal

To build a model that predicts whether a given user will subscribe to the newsletter. 
steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather relevant user information that might influence their decision to subscribe or not.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features.

2. Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for binary classification.
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

3. Feature Selection:
Use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from tree-based models, or dimensionality reduction methods to identify the most important features for predicting subscriptions.
Select features that have a strong correlation with the target variable (subscription).

4. Model Training:
Train the chosen model using the training data and tune hyperparameters to optimize its performance. Use techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using F1-score.

6. Interpretability:
Analyze the model's parameters and feature importances to understand which features contribute the most to predicting subscriptions.

7. Actionable Insights:

Based on the insights from feature analysis, identify potential areas for improvement in the newsletter's conversion rate.
